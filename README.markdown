Description
-----------
The Kinect Dressing Room is a project in which a user is able to try on clothes 
virtually using the Kinect. In the downloadable source code above an executable is 
provided. Opening this with a Kinect connected to your computer, allows you to try 
the Kinect Dressing Room yourself:
- Calibrate by taking the calibration pose for the Kinect.
- After the indicator turns green, hand icons will appear.
- Select and deselect clothing by hover over the buttons on the left.

For this application Unity 3D is used as 3D environment. Most of the code is written 
in csharp and c++. When Unity is installed on your computer, you can open the Unity
Project by selecting the Kinect-DressingRoom folder as project folder.
